# project-tiara-device-client-v2

Project TIARA is a smart doghouse system that has three components, the Device Client (this repo), the [Server](https://github.com/capthndsme/ProjectTiaraBackendServer), and the [Web App](https://github.com/capthndsme/project-tiara-frontend-pwats). For more information, go to the [Project Tiara Repository](https://github.com/capthndsme/ProjectTiara) to learn more about the system.
Right now we lost some work that broke the device client, so its semi-working.

Setup: 
- Download repo into raspberry pi
- install dependencies, install ffmpeg
- configure it
- compile arduino code
